# Panceta

Panceta is a social music experiment. Music helped humans knit together in social groups. It has an extraordinary power not only to evoke emotions, but also to bind us into a group.

With Panceta anyone can create a **music zone**. A music zone is a virtual boundary where you can listen to music that people in the same zone will likely love. When someone enters an existing music zone, their musical preferences are taken into account to automatically adapt the music to the taste of everyone. Once they leave the zone, their preferences fade away.

Use it at your workplace, in a party or at your favorite pub or public space.

## How to create a music zone

To create a zone you only need a **beacon** (see supported beacons list). Beacons are small and cheap devices that broadcast a signal with a unique identifier (beacon id) that acts as the zone name.

The strength of that signal can be adjusted to define the size of the music zone. The stronger the signal, the bigger the music zone will be. The range can go from a few centimeters up to almost one hundred meters. You can even define zones by using several beacons together.

### Supported beacons

Panceta currently supports [Estimote](http://estimote.com/#jump-to-products) beacons. No extra configuration is needed. Just drop your beacon wherever you want to create a new music zone.

### Predefined music zones

Some beacon identifiers are reserved for predefined zones. For example, you can use the id B9407F30-F5F8-466E-AFF9-25556B57FE6D to tune in to the world zone.

| Beacon Identifier                    | Zone Name     |
| ------------------------------------ |:-------------:|
| B9407F30-F5F8-466E-AFF9-25556B57FE6D |    World Zone |

## How to listen to music in a zone

You need a supported player. Grooveshark is currently supported using a [Firefox addon](https://github.com/panceta/panceta-grooveshark-firefox). Jamendo support and an [Android application](https://github.com/panceta/panceta-android) are already under development. Stay tuned.
